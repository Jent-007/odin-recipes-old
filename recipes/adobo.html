    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Philippine adobo (from Spanish adobar: "marinade," "sauce" or "seasoning") is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process in Philippine cuisine that involves 
        meat, seafood, or vegetables marinated in vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black peppercorns, which is browned in oil, and simmered in the marinade. 
        It has occasionally been considered the unofficial national dish in the Philippines.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 whole chicken legs (about 4 pounds), cut into drumstick and thigh sections</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon whole black peppercorns, crushed lightly</li>
        <li>3/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large kettle combine the chicken, the vinegar, the garlic, the bay leaves, the peppercorns, and 1 cup water, bring the mixture to a boil, and simmer it,
            covered, for 20 minutes. Add the soy sauce and simmer the mixture, covered, for 20 minutes. Transfer the chicken with tongs to a plate and boil the liquid for 10 minutes,
            or until it is reduced to about 1 cup. Let the sauce cool, remove the bay leaves, and skim the fat from the surface.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet heat the oil over high heat until it is hot but not smoking and in it saut√© the chicken, patted dry, in batches, turning it, for 5 minutes,
            or until it is browned well. Transfer the chicken to a rimmed platter, pour the sauce, heated, over it, and serve the chicken with the rice.</li>
